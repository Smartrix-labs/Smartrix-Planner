Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Smartrix Planner application (the "Service") operated by us.

1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

2. Description of Service
Smartrix is a productivity application that provides Pomodoro timers, task management, and backup capabilities. The Service is provided "as is" and is intended for personal use.

3. User Data
You are responsible for your own data. Smartrix stores data locally on your device. If you use the Cloud Backup feature (Google Drive / OneDrive), backups are stored in your personal cloud storage accounts. We are not responsible for data loss.

4. Google Drive Integration
By using the Google Drive backup feature, you authorize Smartrix to read and write files to a specific folder in your Google Drive for the purpose of backing up your app data. You retain full ownership and control of your data in Google Drive.

5. Termination
We generally do not have the ability to terminate your access to the Service as it runs locally. However, we reserve the right to revoke API keys or updates if the Service is misused.

6. Changes
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time.
